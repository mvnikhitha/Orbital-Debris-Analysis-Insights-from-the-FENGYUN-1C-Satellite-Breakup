# Orbital Debris Analysis: Insights from the FENGYUN-1C Satellite Breakup

This project explores the orbital characteristics and decay patterns of debris generated by the FENGYUN-1C satellite breakup event (2007). Using publicly available datasets from CelesTrak, the analysis leverages Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for data cleaning, visualization, and correlation studies.

## 📌 Objectives
- Analyze the orbital properties (apogee, perigee, eccentricity, inclination, period).  
- Explore correlations between orbital parameters.  
- Visualize debris distributions and orbital clusters.  
- Study decay potential using perigee heights and GP Age.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Dataset: CelesTrak GP Data (FENGYUN-1C Debris)  

## 📊 Key Visualizations
- Distribution of orbital inclinations and eccentricities  
- Scatter plots of Apogee vs Perigee  
- Correlation heatmap of orbital parameters  
- Survival/decay trend analysis  

## 📈 Research Impact
This study provides insights into space situational awareness and contributes toward understanding long-term risks posed by debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO).
